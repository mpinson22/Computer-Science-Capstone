# Category One: Software Design and Engineering Narrative

## Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?
This artifact is a course catalog application. In its original form, it was a C++ console app that read input from a file and loaded courses 
into a binary search tree to be queried. This version was created in a Data Structures & Algorithms course I took last year. In its new form, 
it is a web application making use of the Dash framework with Python to provide an HTML interface with which users can interact.
