# Category One: Software Design and Engineering Narrative

## Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?
This artifact is a course catalog application. In its original form, it was a C++ console app that read input from a file and loaded courses 
into a binary search tree to be queried. This version was created in a Data Structures & Algorithms course I took last year. In its new form, 
it is a web application making use of the Dash framework with Python to provide an HTML interface with which users can interact.

## Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. 
This artifact was one that I was initially proud of in its C++ form. However, for something like a course catalog, the simple functionality of 
the binary search tree felt a bit lackluster. There was important functionality that I wanted to add and that I thought would be better handled 
by a database in a web application. This artifact shows my ability to take a piece of code written in one language with a particular structural 
implementation and convert it to something thatâ€™s arguably more efficient and effective by making use of my skills as a well-rounded developer. 
My competence in both C++ and Python allows me to pick out the core components of the application logic and convert between the two languages. 
This artifact also proves my ability to create an intuitive HTML interface using the Dash framework, showcasing my UI skills. Finally, 
this application was built essentially from scratch. I had absolutely no Python code for this particular application before beginning to write it, 
so this artifact demonstrates my ability to take a process through the development cycle, redesigning, implementing, and testing.

## Did you meet the course objectives you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? 

## Reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact.
