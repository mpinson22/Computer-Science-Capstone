# Category Two Narrative: Databases

## Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?
This artifact is a new creation but is loosely based on a project that I did in CS-300, my data structures and algorithms course in the fall of 2023. That course had us create an app that loaded data from a spreadsheet and then allowed the user to either perform quick sort or selection sort on the data. This new artifact is an applet that allows users to choose between bubble sort, selection sort, quick sort, and merge sort, select a number of values, and then watch the data be sorted in a bar graph animation. 

## Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. 
This artifact solidly demonstrates my ability to implement various sorting algorithms and showcase their efficiencies. This artifact is pretty clearly intended to prove my accomplishment of the course objective relating to algorithms because I didnâ€™t feel that my improvements to my project for categories one and three showcased that ability. People in all industries are looking to data visualization to draw conclusions about how best to proceed in business, and this project showcases my ability to be a part of this emerging trend in computer science.

## Did you meet the course objectives you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? 

## Reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact.
